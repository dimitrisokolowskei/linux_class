# Graduate Bioinformatics Linux Course
 Here I'll share and describe the bioinformatics tasks and scripts that I've done to the *Special Molecular Biology Topics: Introduction to Linux*, an graduate level course taught at University of Bras√≠lia (UnB).
## Requisites
To run the *scripts* some pieces of *software* will be required:
- [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/):
- [seqkit](https://github.com/shenwei356/seqkit):
- [ncbi-genome-download](https://github.com/kblin/ncbi-genome-download/):
