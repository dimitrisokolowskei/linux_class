# Graduate Bioinformatics Linux Course
 Here I'll share and describe the bioinformatics tasks and scripts that I've done to the *Special Molecular Biology Topics: Introduction to Linux*, an graduate level course taught at University of Bras√≠lia (UnB).
## Requisites
To run the *scripts* some pieces of *software* will be required:
- [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/): A package and enviroment manager that exist to facilitate our lifes.  
- [seqkit](https://github.com/shenwei356/seqkit): An ultrafast toolkit for FASTA/Q files manipulation. 
- [ncbi-genome-download](https://github.com/kblin/ncbi-genome-download/): Allows the *download* of biological data from NCBI databases. 
- [EMBOSS](http://emboss.open-bio.org/): EMBOSS comprises a diversity of bioinformatic *softwares* and tools for a wide range of analysis. 
- [entrez-direct](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK179288/): Tool used to acess NCBI databases throught UNIX terminal.
- [MAFFT](https://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/software/): Consists in a major multiple sequence alignment program for *web* and UNIX-like systems.
- [Blast](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK569839/): BLAST Alignment tool for command-lines.
